# ECE 5725 Spring 2019: Piano Performance Tracking 
This project is an attempt to integrate audio processing with the Raspberry Pi 3, creating an interface that allows user to compare his/her piano recording with a professional recording. The software detects and displays the timing of notes played, the relative frequencies and note velocity to the professional's.
